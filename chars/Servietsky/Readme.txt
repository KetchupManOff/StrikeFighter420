Towelie by Pokemaster2016/Somebody407

Towelie is a character from the popular adult cartoon, South Park.
He's a genetically modified towel created by Tynacorp, and was capable of highly intelligent tasks. However, he completely changed when he got high one day.
In episodes he appeared in, he often gave the boys towel advice and asked them if they wanted to get high.
Despite being made a bad character on purpose, Towelie has gained a cult following overtime, leading to him returning in future episodes, like "Professor Chaos", "A Million Little Fibers", "Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants", and appearing as a boss in the 2017 video game "South Park: The Fractured But Whole."

I made Towelie in M.U.G.E.N because of a lack of South Park characters made in MUGEN, and an even bigger lack of actually decent ones. This may not be the only South Park character I make.

In M.U.G.E.N, Towelie incorporates Marvel vs. Capcom gameplay, and as such is very combo-heavy. He has access to aerial raves, recovery rolls, strikers, and other mechanics commonly seen in MvC.

Towelie is also very projectile heavy, having access to many long-range attacks.

Towelie is very easy to pick up and play, which makes him a good candidate for beginner players.

Towelie only works for M.U.G.E.N 1.0 and up. He probably won't work in WINMUGEN because of some of the features M.U.G.E.N 1.0 has that Towelie uses.

==Moveset==

===Mechanics===

F, F or B, B = Dash (Can also be done in the air)

D, U or U if Standing C or Crouching Z successfully hits the opponent = Super Jump

F or B when downed = Roll Dodge

PP when blocking attacks = Guard Push

===Specials===

QCF, x/y/z = Bong Hit (Air OK) - Towelie smokes a bong and then shoots 5 small smoke clouds at the enemy.
The velocity of each cloud changes depending on the strength of the punch.

QCB, x/y/z = Marijuana Grenade (Ground Only) - Towelie throws a grenade filled with marijuana. The grenade will explode either when it makes contact with the opponent, or when it hasn't been touched for 1.5 seconds. 
The velocity of how far the grenade goes changes depending on the strength of the punch.

QCF, a/b/c = Towel Bash (Ground Only) - Towelie uses his body to hurt the opponent.

QCF, a/b/c = Body Slam (Air Only) - Towelie uses his body to slam the opponent. Also an OTG.

D, D, a/b/c = Dry Off (Ground Only) - Towelie dries off and gets water all over nearby opponents.

QCB, a/b/c = Summon Strikers (Ground Only) - see below

===Strikers===

QCB, a = Underpants Gnomes - Towelie summons a horde of Underpants Gnomes, which trip the opponent while taking their underwear.

QCB, b = Muhammad - Muhammad appears and throws a projectile at the opponent. I don't know what the projectile is supposed to be due to Comedy Central being pussies, so just use your imagination.

QCB, c = Mr. Hankey - Mr. Hankey appears and creates a cloud made of shit. The cloud rains on the opponent, so you will probably have to run to avoid it.

===Supers===

QCF, KK = Thermite Bong (LEVEL 1)- Taken from his boss fight in The Fractured But Whole, Towelie pulls out a lighter and some spray and burns the opponent. Only useful close-range.

QCB, PP = Mage of Mantros (LEVEL 1) - Towelie gains magic powers and summons a shower of weed comets.

QCF, PP = Towel Torrent (LEVEL 2) - A large stream of water comes from nowhere and hits the opponent.

HCB, KK = High Mode (LEVEL 3) - Towelie gets high, and gains some nifty effects. He can gain one of five different effects:

===High Mode Effects===

1. Custom Combos - Can combo however he likes. Lasts for 10 seconds.

2. Unlimited Strikers - Not necessarily unlimited, but he can have all three strikers out at the same time. Lasts for 10 seconds.

3. Attack Boost - Attack is increased by 1.5x. Lasts for 12.5 seconds.

4. Regeneration - Towelie slowly gains health back. Lasts for 7.5 seconds.

5. Invincibility - Cannot be attacked. Lasts for 10 seconds.

==Notes==

Towelie has a special intro against Juan by Quetzalcoatl_88, depending on which intro he has. The special intro activates during Juan's intro where he kills Towelie.

Whatever you do, do not put Towelie against FourthRhyme's Bubsy, as sometimes, Bubsy gets stuck when he's hit with Thermite Bong.

==Change log==

===Official Release===
Put Ceil over some pos codes
Increased range on his aerials
Made High Mode easier to perform
Added super portrait

===What I may do later===

Arcade storyboards

Give him a throw

Animation compatibilities

Add more sound effects and voice clips

==Rules==
1. No retarded, symbiote, or any low-effort edits (unless new attacks are added or a significant amount of stuff coding-wise is changed or added.)

2. You can use his sprites or sounds, just as long as you give credit.

3. However, YOU CANNOT USE HIS CODE WITHOUT PERMISSION. I can't stand characters with stolen coding, and I probably won't be a happy camper if I find out someone stole my code without me knowing. Even if you do ask, there may be a chance that I'll say no.
