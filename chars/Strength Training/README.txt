 - Custom time, score, and life display



=====<Installation>=====

 - Extract StrengthTraining.rar to your Mugen\chars folder
 - Add "StrengthTraining," to your select.def, under [Characters]



=====<Introduction>=====

  This is a Mugen Bonus Stage based on Art Of Fighting 2, the one where you had to fight
multiple enemies at a time, kind of like a Beat'em Up game.

  The rules are different from the original game, here you have 30 seconds (or whatever you
choose in CONFIG.txt) to see how many thugs you can beat.
  To beat them you'll need to inflict enough damage on them (usually one strong attack is
enough), or just knock them down.

  You'll face one thug at a time in the first round, two in the second, three in the third and
so on. Also, if you have a partner their numbers double.

  You automatically win once the timer runs out, so don't worry about getting Game Over.

  Check CONFIG.txt for several options.
