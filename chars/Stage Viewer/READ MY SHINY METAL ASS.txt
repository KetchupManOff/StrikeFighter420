===========================
Stage Viewer
===========================
For M.U.G.E.N 1.0

This character is a sort of proof of concept for what can be done in-game to view stages.
It's kind of unorthodox so it's very possible there's some bugs. Report them to 
me and i'll see what i can do. Keep in mind it acts as a single entity in a mirror match
scenario, but the opponent still technically exists. This effect doesn't occur against
actual characters

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! W A R N I N G !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In order to use this character correctly, they MUST be player 1. Haven't worked out all the kinks there,
but for the most part i don't see it as much of an issue. Just something to note
