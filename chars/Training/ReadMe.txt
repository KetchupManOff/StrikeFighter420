High Resolution Sandbag
Super Smash Bros. Melee

Mugen Version: WinMugen

The Sandbag is NOT a playable character.
The only use for it is to be a training
dummy, to test any of your mugen combos,
and to beat the living crap out of it.

A pocket sized version of sandbag is
available for smaller characters.
Use psandpag.def included for the
small version of the sandbag.

Have Fun!
