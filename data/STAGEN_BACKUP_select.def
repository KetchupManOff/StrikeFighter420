; HOW TO ADD CHARACTERS
;===========================================================
[Characters]
 ;Use the format:
 ;    charname, stagefilename1, stagefilename2, ...
 ;
 ;eg. For a player with filename "kfm",
 ;    and stage filename "stages/mybg.def"
 ;type (without the semicolon):
 ;    kfm, stages/mybg.def
 ;    IKEMEN feature: There can be more than 1 stage assigned to
 ;    character. In such case stage will be randomly chosen.
 ;
 ;If you want to load a different def file, you can enter it
 ;as a directory plus the def file. This example loads up
 ;chars/kfm/alt-kfm.def:
 ;    kfm/alt-kfm.def, stages/mybg.def
 ;
 ;If you put "random" as the stagefilename, then a random stage will
 ;be selected for that player. eg.
 ;IKEMEN feature: Not really needed since no stage = random anyway.
 ;    kfm, random
 ;
 ;Optional parameters may follow on the same line, separated
 ;by commas. Each parameter has the form:
 ;    paramname = paramvalue
 ;where paramname is the name of the parameter type, and
 ;paramvalue is the value to assign that parameter.
 ;The optional parameters are:
 ;
 ; - music
 ;   Set the paramvalue to the name of the music file to use
 ;   as the BGM for that character. This overrides the bgmusic
 ;   parameter in the stage's .def file, so you can re-use the
 ;   same stage for multiple characters, but have a different
 ;   BGM playing for each person.
 ;   IKEMEN feature: There can be more than 1 music parameter
 ;   set for stage. In such case track will be randomly chosen.
 ;
 ; - zoom
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid stage zoom
 ;   even if it is enabled globally. Useful for characters that 
 ;   don't work well with zoom (for example bonus characters)
 ;
 ; - boss
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 1 to include this
 ;   character in "Boss Rush" mode.
 ;
 ; - bonus
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 1 to include this
 ;   character in "Bonus Games" mode. Bonus characters also
 ;   won't show up as Simul team if faced in arcade mode.
 ;
 ; - ai
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue between 0 and 8 to force
 ;   AI Level regardless of difficulty and AI ramping settings.
 ;
 ; - vsscreen
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid displaying versus screen
 ;   when facing this character.
 ;
 ; - victoryscreen
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid displaying
 ;   victory screen after beating this character.
 ;
 ; - single
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 1 to force facing this character
 ;   individually in arcade team modes.
 ;
 ; - includestage
 ;   Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid including this stage
 ;   in the stage select list (in VS, training modes, etc)
 ;
 ; - exclude
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to 1 to avoid including
 ;   this character when player choose 'random' character icon.
 ;   Also excludes character to be chosen by CPU in modes other
 ;   than arcade (arcade selection is controlled by 'order')
 ;
 ; - order
 ;   Set the paramvalue to the ordering priority to give the
 ;   character in arcade mode (1 by default). A smaller value
 ;   means you will fight the character sooner. You will never
 ;   fight an order 2 character before an order 1 character,
 ;   and never an order 3 character before an order 2 one.
 ;   For example, you might want to set your boss character
 ;   to have order=3. The default order value is 1 if you omit
 ;   this param. See *.maxmatches under [Options] for how to
 ;   limit the number of matches per order priority.
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Max 30 orders limitation is lifted.
 ;
 ; - 1, 2, (...)
 ;   IKEMEN feature: paramname points to the match number in
 ;   arcade mode. paramvalue overwrites character that you would
 ;   face following normal 'order'. paramvalue should match exactly
 ;   the charname text typed after "Insert your characters below"
 ;   line, so it can be either full DEF path or just folder name.
 ;   This functionality introduces simple solution for implementing
 ;   story like arcade mode similar to the one in Street Fighter
 ;   Alpha 3 where characters always face their rivals along the way.
 ;   If you're playing in Team mode than paramvalue character becomes
 ;   opposite team leader, other characters follow normal order.
 ;
 ;   Full Order Reference:
 ;	 charname, stages/.def, music=sound/.mp3, zoom=0, boss=1, bonus=1, ai=5, vsscreen=0, victoryscreen=0, single=1, includestage=0, exclude=1, order=1, 1=charname, 4=charname
 ;
 ;   Some examples:
 ;        kfm, stages/mybg.def, includestage=0
 ;        kfm, stages/mybg.def, music=sound/song.mp3
 ;        kfm, stages/mybg.def, music=sound/song.mp3, includestage=0
 ;        kfm, stages/mybg.def, order=3, 3=kfm, 6=SuaveDude
 ;        kfm, stages/mybg.def, stages/mybg.def, music=sound/song.mp3, music=sound/song2.mp3, zoom=0
 ;		  kfm, stages/mybg.def, music=sound/song.mp3, zoom=0, bonus=1, vsscreen=0, victoryscreen=0, includestage=0, exclude=1, order=3
 ;		  kfm, stages/mybg.def, music=sound/song.mp3, zoom=0, boss=1, ai=8, includestage=0, exclude=1, order=5
 ;
 ;You can also add a randomize icon to the select screen. To do
 ;this, put the word "randomselect" on a line of its own, with no
 ;extra parameters.

 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to overwrite global
 ;   maximum zoom in setting for this particular stage.

[Options]
 ;Here you set the maximum number of matches to fight before game ends
 ;in Arcade Mode. The first number is the number of matches against
 ;characters with order=1, followed by order=2 and order=3 respectively.
 ;For example, for 4,3,1 you will fight up to 4 randomly-picked
 ;characters who have order=1, followed by 3 with order=2 and 1 with
 ;order=3.
 ;IKEMEN feature: Max 30 orders limitation is lifted.
arcade.maxmatches = 1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;Maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in Team Mode.
 ;Like arcade.maxmatches, but applies to Team Battle.
team.maxmatches = 1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;IKEMEN feature: AI ramping settings has been moved here from mugen.cfg
 ;You can view AI ramping output for all battles from the last chosen mode
 ;via debug/t_aiRamp.txt (useful reference also for vanilla mugen).
 ;Arcade Mode AI ramping. For both parameters below, the first number
 ;corresponds to the number of matches won, and the second number to the
 ;AI difficulty offset. The actual difficulty is the sum of the AI
 ;difficulty level (set in the options menu) and the value of the offset
 ;at a particular match.
 ;  AIramp.start = start_match, start_diff
 ;  AIramp.end   = end_match, end_diff
 ;The difficulty offset function is a constant value of start_diff from
 ;the first match until start_match matches have been won. From then the
 ;offset value increases linearly from start_diff to end_diff. After
 ;end_diff matches have been won, the offset value is end_diff.

 ;     ^      ^     ^        ^
 ;   1st_m   s_m   e_m     last_m
 ;For example, if you have:
 ;  AIramp.start = 2,0
 ;  AIramp.end   = 4,2
 ;For 6 matches at level 4, the difficulty will be (by match):
 ;  4,4,4,5,6,6
arcade.AIramp.start = 2, 0
arcade.AIramp.end   = 4, 2

 ;Team Mode AI ramping
 ;For 4 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be:
 ;  4,4,5,6
team.AIramp.start = 1, 0
team.AIramp.end   = 3, 2

 ;Survival Mode AI ramping
 ;For 16 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be:
 ;  1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8
survival.AIramp.start = 0, -3
survival.AIramp.end   = 16, 4
